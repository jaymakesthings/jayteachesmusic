      <h2>HELLO,</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Jay. I am a music instructor from the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area who specializes in guitar, bass, and music theory. After more than a decade of experience with my primary instrument, I decided to share my knowledge & passion through professional music lessons. Since I began teaching in January of 2016, I have worked as an instructor for Guitar Center, Music & Arts, Bach to Rock, FineArtsMatter, and B&B Music Lessons, teaching students of all ages and skill levels.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am familiar with many styles of music, from metal & hard rock to country, pop, and classical. One thing I do not want to do is bore students with one particular style of music that I think they should learn&mdash;I want to teach what you want to learn! Music lessons should be fun, and I always try my absolute best to find the perfect balance between exciting & educational.
      </p>
      <p>
        As far as location, I teach wherever you are most comfortable learning! Whether it be over an internet connection via Skype or Facetime, in one of my studio locations, or in your home&mdash;just let me know which you prefer and I will make it happen. I currently offer lessons for electric guitar, acoustic guitar, classical guitar, electric bass guitar, and ukulele.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you've made it this far, thank you for visiting & reading about what I have to offer as an instructor! Teaching music is a dream job, and I am so grateful for the opportunity to do this for a living. Please visit the FAQ page if you would like to know more, and head over to the Contact page to schedule your first lesson! I look forward to working with you.
