      <h2>LEARNING AN INSTRUMENT IS A SERIOUS COMMITMENT,</h2>
      <p>And I assume you may still have some questions. That's why I've compiled this handy dandy list of questions I've been asked at some point in the past & anticpate people may ask at some point in the future!
      </p>
      <h3>Q: How long are your lessons?</h3>
      <p>
        A: Great Q! My lessons will typically vary in length from 30 to 60 minutes, depending on what the student is most comfortable with. If requested, I would also be more than happy to teach lessons greater than one hour in length!
      </p>
      <h3>Q: What are your rates?</h3>
      <p>
        A: Wow, another great question! For lessons taught in your home, an hour-long session is $60 and a half-hour is $40. If the student's preference is to take lessons via Skype or Facetime, lessons are $50 for an hour, and $30 for 30 minutes. If the student would prefer to take lessons at one of my studio locations, please contact the studio at which they're interested in learning, as rates vary based on location.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Q: What & where are the aforementioned studio locations at which you claim to teach?
      </h3>
      <p>
        A: Currently, I teach music lessons at the Music & Arts located in Springfield, Virginia, and at the newly-renovated Guitar Center located in Fairfax, Virginia. I also teach private lessons in students' homes through a company called B&B Music Lessons.
      </p>
      <h3>Q: Are you open to working with students who have special needs?</h3>
      <p>A: Absolutely.</p>
      <h3>
        Q: I love your website! How can I get an awesome website like this?
      </h3>
      <p>
        A: Thanks! I coded it myself using HTML5 & CSS3, and also have experience working with JavaScript & Ruby on Rails. If you are interested in having me design & code a website for your blog, business, band, or anything at all, send me an email at <a href='mailto:jaymakesthings@gmail.com'>jaymakesthings@gmail.com</a>!
      </p>
      <h3>Q: What's your favorite TV show?</h3>
      <p>
        A: It's a tie between Twin Peaks, Adventure Time, and Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown.
      </p>
      <h3>Q: Favorite color?</h3>
      <p>A: Seafoam green.</p>
      <h3>Q: Do you believe that human beings are inherently good?</h3>
      <p>A: Yes.</p>
